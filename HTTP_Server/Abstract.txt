This is a HTTP_Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/Network/html/_compact__web__server__example.html

Use this example to connect an evaluation board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). The example will configure the network
parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect an evaluation
board to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this case
configure a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and disable
a 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c configuration file.
The default static IP address of this example is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your web browser and enter the
address http://evkb-imxrt1050/ or http://<boards IP address>

The HTTP_Server program is a standalone application preconfigured for
EVKB-IMXRT1050 Evaluation Board.

The program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - Code:                      External HyperFlash NOR
   - RW:                        Internal RAM
   - Debugger:                  CMSIS-DAP
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Enabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Source
   - Network:CORE:              IPv4/IPv6 Debug
 - Release:
   - Code:                      External HyperFlash NOR
   - RW:                        Internal RAM
   - Debugger:                  CMSIS-DAP
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Compiler:Event Recorder:   Disabled
   - CMSIS:RTOS2:Keil RTX5:     Library
   - Network:CORE:              IPv4/IPv6 Release

Notes:
 - Power the board with external power through J2 barrel connector with 
   stable 5V voltage (center +), jumper J1 short 1-2, switch SW1 position 2-3
 - Define ETH_PHY_REF_CLK_50M=1 must be set to build KSZ8081RNA
   Ethernet PHY driver with support for 50MHz reference clock.
 - LCD output is re-targeted to debug console (virtual COM port) accessible on the
   same J28 connector as CMSIS-DAP debugger.
